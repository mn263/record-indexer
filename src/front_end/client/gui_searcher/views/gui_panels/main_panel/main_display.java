//	Your GUI should mimic the structure and layout of the demo GUI. This applies to the main Indexing Window
// 	as well as the various dialog windows.
//	The main Indexing Window should be resizable, but the dialog windows should not be.
//	All dialog windows should be modal (i.e., the user must close the dialog window before being allowed to interact
//	with other parts of the GUI).
