//	The “Zoom In”and “Zoom Out”buttons should adjust the scale (i.e., zoom level) of the image. Zooming should be done
// 	relative to the center point of the currently visible area. That is, as zooming occurs, the point at the center of
// 	the view should remain fixed.
//	The “Invert Image”button should turn image inversion on and off.
//	The “Toggle Highlights”button should turn field highlights on and off.
//	The “Save”button should save the state of the user’s work to disk. (See the section entitled Saving Per-User State for details.)
//	The “Submit”button should submit the current batch to the Server, and put the Indexing Window in an empty state.
// 	When a batch is submitted, all record field values entered by the user should be sent to the Server.
// 	The Server should save the indexed values, and increment the number of records indexed by the user.
