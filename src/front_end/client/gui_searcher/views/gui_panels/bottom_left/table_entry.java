//	If no one is logged in, or no batch is currently being indexed by the logged in user, the Table Entry Tab should be empty.
//	When a batch is being indexed, the table should contain a “Record Number”column that displays record numbers and is
//	read-only. The table should also contain editable columns for all of the project fields in the proper order.
//	When the screen space allocated to the Table Entry Tab is too small to fully display the table, scroll bars should
//	be provided so the user can scroll the view.
//	The TAB key should move the field selection in a left-to-right, top-to-bottom order.
//	Unrecognized field values should be highlighted red.
//			Right-clicking on an unrecognized field value (i.e., one that is highlighted red) should bring up a context
//	menu containing a “See Suggestions”menu item. Selecting the “See Suggestions”menu item should display the Suggestions Dialog. If the user selects a suggested value and clicks the “Use Suggestion”button, the selected value should replace the unrecognized value in the table.
