//	When the user selects the “See Suggestions”menu item either in the Table Entry Tab or Form Entry Tab,
// 	the Suggestions Dialog should be displayed.
//	The Suggestions Dialog should display all known field values that are edit distance one or two from the value
// 	provided by the user. (Refer to the Spell Corrector project for information on how to calculate edit distance.)
//	The list of suggested values should display a scroll bar if it is too long to fit in the screen space allocated
// 	to the list.


//	Quality Checker Unit Testing
//	When you implement the Quality Checker feature, you will need to write code to:
//	1. Check to see if a user-provided field value is a “known value”or not
//	1. Given an unknown user-provided field value, calculate the suggested values to display to the user
// 	(i.e., known values that are edit distance one or two from the user-provided value)
//	Write automated unit tests to verify that this code is working properly. Add your tests to the client.
// 	ClientUnitTests class, or create additional test classes of your own. If you add more unit test classes,
// 	add their names to the testClasses array in the client.ClientUnitTests main method. The TAs will run your unit
// 	tests by running the following ANT command:
//	ant client-tests
//	When you are done, all of your unit tests must run successfully (i.e., no failures).
