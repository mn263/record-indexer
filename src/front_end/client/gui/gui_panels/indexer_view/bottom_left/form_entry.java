//	If no one is logged in, or no batch is currently being indexed by the logged in user, the Form Entry Tab should be empty.
//	When a batch is being indexed, the left side of the Form Entry Tab should contain a list of record numbers that allows the user to select the current record. The right side of the Form Entry Tab should contain labeled text boxes for all of the project fields in the proper order. These text fields should be editable.
//	When the screen space allocated to the Form Entry Tab is too small to fully display the record number list or the form fields, scroll bars should be provided so the user can scroll the view.
//	The TAB key should move the field selection in a top-to-bottom order.
//	Unrecognized field values should be highlighted red.
//			Right-clicking on an unrecognized field value (that is highlighted red) should bring up a context menu containing a “See Suggestions”menu item. Selecting the “See Suggestions”menu item should display the Suggestions Dialog. If the user selects a suggested value and clicks the “Use Suggestion”button, the selected value should replace the unrecognized value in the form.
