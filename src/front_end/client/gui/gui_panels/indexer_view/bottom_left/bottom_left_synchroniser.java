//	Synchronization of Image Panel, Table Entry Tab, and Form Entry Tab
//	The currently-selected record field is displayed in three views: the Image Panel, the Table Entry Tab, and the Form
//	Entry Tab. All of these views allow the user to move the current selection from one field to another. Regardless of
//	how the current selection is changed, all three views must be kept in synch with each other. For example, if the
//	user clicks on a record field in the Image Panel, thus changing the current selection, the current selection in the Table Entry Tab and Form Entry Tab must be updated to show the new selection. Similarly, if the user selects a different cell in the Table Entry Tab, the Image Panel and Form Entry Tab must be updated to show the new selection. The same is true if the current selection is changed through the Form Entry Tab.
